                <h3>Leonard Ng Wei Tat</h3>
                <p>Leonard received his PhD in Engineering from the University of Cambridge in Engineering in 2019 where he worked on
                developing low-cost and high-throughput printed electronics using Graphene and other 2d materials. Leonard is also a former
                NTU International Postdoctoral Scholar, where he undertook a 2-year visiting appointment the Commonwealth Scientific
                International Research organisation (CSIRO). He is also a recipient of the Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise
                Fellowship where he developed commercial applications in the renewable energy sector in the United Kingdom (UK) and
                Europe based on his patents.
            His research now focuses on data-driven techniques for roll-to-roll printed flexible electronics, in particular
            photovoltaics. Specifically, his work revolves around additive manufacturing, printing, and polymer composites for a
            variety of sustainable applications. Additionally, his research uses machine-learning enabled inverse design to
            continuously improve high-throughput manufacturing.</p>

                    <h3>Nur Fadilah Jamaludin</h3>
                    <p>Fadilah has carved a notable path in the field of materials science with her expertise in electrochemical
                    devices and advanced material research. Her journey began with a short but impactful internship at Robert Bosch (SEA)
                    Pte Ltd in Singapore, where she dedicated a month in 2014 to developing electrochemical devices aimed at enhancing
                    indoor air quality through gas sensing capabilities. This role not only honed her skills in the practical applications
                    of organic molecules but also led her to establish new standard operating protocols for the rapid screening of promising
                    materials.
                    Following her stint in the industry, Fadilah transitioned into academia, where she further expanded her research
                    horizons. From April 2020 to October 2021, she served as a Research Fellow at the Energy Research Institute @ NTU,
                    engaging in projects that required a deep understanding of data analysis and presentation skills among others. Her
                    contributions during this 1 year and 7 months tenure were marked by significant advancements in the field of energy
                    research, underscoring her capability to blend technical expertise with impactful research outcomes.
                    In her previosu position, Fadilah was a Research Fellow at the Applied Materials-NUS Advanced Materials Corporate Lab, part of the
                     National University of Singapore.
